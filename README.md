📊 Customer Segmentation using Clustering
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, particularly KMeans Clustering, to analyze a dataset containing demographic and behavioral information.

The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on selected features such as Income and Age, enabling more targeted marketing strategies.

🧾 Dataset Overview
The dataset used (segmentation_data.csv) contains customer data with the following key attributes:

ID: Unique identifier

Age

Income

And possibly other segmentation-relevant features

🧪 Key Steps
🧼 Data Preprocessing
Checked and handled missing values

Visualized data distributions with sns.distplot

Generated a correlation heatmap for initial insights

Feature selection for clustering (Age and Income)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Distribution plots for each feature

Box plot visualization of Age vs Income

Correlation heatmap for multivariate relationships

🔍 Clustering Model
KMeans Clustering

Used the elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters

Trained a KMeans model with k=4

Visualized clusters and centroids

Scaled the features for better clustering performance

📈 Results
Successfully segmented customers into 4 groups

Visualized the clusters with color-coded scatter plots

Identified cluster centroids for interpretation

🛠 Libraries Used
pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)

📌 How to Run

🚀 Future Enhancements
Try DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering

Perform clustering using all features

Add dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) for better visuals
